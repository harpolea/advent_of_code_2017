# :christmas_tree: Advent of Code 2017 :christmas_tree:

My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017) challenges.

This year, I shall be attempting to complete the challenges in C++ using the new [xeus-cling](https://blog.jupyter.org/interactive-workflows-for-c-with-jupyter-fe9b54227d92) C++ kernel for jupyter notebooks. Weekend challenges will be in plain C++ as `xeus-cling` currently only has a linux installer. Where that fails / I run out of time, I will probably fall back to using Python.
